# SymbolicEqual

This function utilises the [`SymPy`](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) to provide a maths-aware comparsion of a student's response to the correct answer. This means that mathematically equivalent inputs will be marked as correct. Note that `pi` is a reserved constant and cannot be used as a symbol name.

This function allows omitting `*` and using `^` instead of `**` if the grading parameter `strict_syntax` is set to false. In this case it is also recommended to list any multicharacter symbols (that are not part of the default list of SI units) expected to appear in the response as input symbols.
